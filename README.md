This repository contains a structured data quality profiling report for a banking campaign dataset used for customer outreach and product marketing. The objective is to evaluate the dataset’s integrity, identify potential risks, and assess its readiness for business, analytical, and compliance-driven applications. The report recommended:

1. Impute or flag disguised nulls ahead of modelling and compliance workflows
2. Investigate outliers to distinguish real long-tail behaviour from data entry issues
3. Review loan–default overlaps for risk modelling and reporting
4. Integrate data profiling checks into notebooks or dashboards for repeatability and auditability
